# smallsh
Small Shell Project

This program is a fully functional shell that can be run at the command line.
It includes a couple built-in commands, file redirection, as well as managing 
background and foreground parent/child processes. It also encorporates a custom
signal handler.

To get started, download or clone the files onto your computer. Next, open a bash
terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are saved. 

In the directory type the following command and hit enter:

```
make smallsh
```

This will compile smallsh.c into an executable file called smallsh.exe.

Now you are ready to run the program by typing the following commanding and
hitting enter:

```
./ smallsh
```

While smallsh is running, feel free to experiment with basic commands you might
use in a regular bash terminal. Where you are ready to exit the program, type
the following command and hit enter:

```
exit
```
